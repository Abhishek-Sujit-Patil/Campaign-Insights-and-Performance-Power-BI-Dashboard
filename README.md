# Market Mindz – Campaign & Customer Insights Dashboard

## Overview
This Power BI project analyses the effectiveness of multiple marketing campaigns run by Market Mindz.  
The dashboard consolidates campaign, product, platform, and customer data into three key views to support management decision-making.

## Problem
Market Mindz lacked clarity on:
- Which campaigns were most effective in driving purchases and revenue.
- Who their key customers were (demographics, behaviours, preferences).
- How sales channels (store, web, catalogue, deals) influenced purchases.
- What underlying drivers determined campaign success.

## Solution
A Power BI dashboard was developed with three core views:
1. **Campaign Performance** – purchases, sales, and platform breakdowns.
2. **Buyer Composition** – demographics, income, education, marital status, and age-based preferences.
3. **Purchase Drivers** – Key Influencers analysis to uncover factors driving campaign acceptance and sales.

## Insights
- Campaign 6 delivered the most purchases, while Campaigns 5 and 6 generated the highest revenue.
- Wine was the strongest product across campaigns, followed by meat.
- In-store dominated purchases (13K), with web and catalogue as secondary but significant channels.
- Typical customers were 56 years old, earned £52K, and were married graduates.
- Higher income and households without children/teens were the strongest drivers of campaign success.

## Business Value
The dashboard provided Market Mindz with:
- A clear view of which campaigns to prioritise for maximum ROI.
- Evidence to benchmark future campaigns against Campaign 6’s strategy.
- Channel strategy insights to reinforce in-store dominance while improving online presence.
- Customer segmentation guidance for more targeted marketing campaigns.
- Budget optimisation opportunities by focusing on high-performing campaigns and products.
